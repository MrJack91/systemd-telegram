# systemd-telegram - Telegram notifications for systemd units

_Disclaimer_: This project is not affiliated with [systemd][systemd]. The name
may suggest it, but I just could not come up with something better.

This repository provides a script and systemd service to send notifications via
[Telegram][telegram] after a unit completes.

## Requirements

- [systemd][systemd]

## Installation

The script, as well as a systemd [service][systemd.service], can be installed
with the provided `Makefile`.

You may need root privileges to execute the `Makefile`.
As with everything coming from the internet, please review the files before
executing anything!

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lukasdietrich/systemd-telegram
cd systemd-telegram/
sudo make install
```

If you want to update, but not override the configuration, you can install only
the script and systemd unit.

```sh
git pull
sudo make update
```

The `Makefile` creates backups when overriding files. If you wish to change
that, you can set the `BACKUP` variable.
See the documentation of [install][install] for further details.

```sh
sudo make update BACKUP=none
```

## Configuration

To send notifications via [Telegram][telegram] you need a bot `token` and your
personal `chat_id`. To create both, please see the documentation of the
[BotFather][botfather].

`chat_id` can be optained with:
```bash
curl \
    "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates""
```

Once obtained, both secrets need to be configured in
`/usr/local/etc/systemd-telegram/telegram.env`.

### Using `--user` units

To send notifications with `--user` units, you need to add the above bot secrets
(or a new pair) to `~/.config/systemd-telegram/telegram.env`.

### Send notifications on failure

To send a notification on failure (including the journal logs), you must create
a drop-in for the [service][systemd.service] in question.

```sh
systemctl edit my-service.service

# [Unit]
# OnFailure=systemd-telegram@%n.service
```


### Send notifications on success

If you want to send notifications on success, too, add another line with
`OnSuccess` instead of `OnFailure`. Successful executions do not include journal
logs.
